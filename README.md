# Noting my life

Today is the first week in  my third year of HuaQiao university. I want to note the steps that I am to be a smarter stronger boy.And I hope I have the capacity of proficiency in spoken and written English

Last year,I didn't pay any attention to my course. By the Coronavirus,I have to stay at home during half a year!The weight increase deservedly up to 78kg.

Stare at the fattest face and the lowest GPA,I swear that I must to be a better man in next year.

Therefore I write this markdown,and will note what I do and What I want to do every week. I hope when I review the year's article I written,I will find I have changed a lot!
